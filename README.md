# Buenamano store website

This project consists on a Single Page Application to showcase the work of Buenamano ice cream factory.
Buenamano is a small business located in Pichilemu, Chile, where Dani and Renato produce artisanal ice creams with innovative flavors.
Their aim is not only to give their clients the best products, offering options for diverse types of diets but also to promote regional ingredients and sustainability.
Due to the nature of the product, the creation of a traditional storefront that allow them to automatise sells is not required. Instead, we decided this website should focus on:

1. Allow clients to have detailed information of the products.
2. Expand the possibilities for new partnerships.

To achieve these goals, the website presents:

1. Several menu forms where information of each product can be accessed in different levels of detail.
2. A communication channel for HORECA (Hotels, Restaurants and Caf√©s) customers.
3. A homepage that showcases the history, , and values of the company.
