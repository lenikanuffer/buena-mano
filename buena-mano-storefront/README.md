#Buenamano store website

This project consist on a SPA to showcase the work of Buenamano ice cream factory.
Buenamano is a small business located in Pichilemu, Chile, where Dani and Renato produce artisanal ice creams with innovative flavours.
Their aim is not only to give their clients the best products, offering options for diverse types of diets, but also to promote regional ingredients and sustainability.
Due to the nature of the product, the creation of a traditional storefront that allow them to automatise sells is not required. Instead, we decided this website should focus on:

1. Allow clients to have detailed information of the products.
2. Expand the posibilities for new partnerships.

In order to achieve these goals, the website presents:

1. Several menu forms where information about each product can be accesed in different levels of detail.
2. An exclusive chanel of communication for HORECA customers (Hotels, Restaurants and Caf√©s).
3. A homepage that showcase the history, mission and values of the company.
